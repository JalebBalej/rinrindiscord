# rinrindiscord
My first ever Discord bot written in Python.

What I'm working on right now
----------
Right now I'm trying to implement a localization system, although the way it's being implemented relies on me to add the languages to the code via files instead of using SQL as I find it way easier to use files.

Developer Note:
----------
I'm not sure what I'm planning on doing with Rin Rin ❤, I only started writing in Python recently and it's my first programming language to mess around with (besides LUA). I hope to make Rin Rin ❤ into a useful Discord bot for moderation, fun, games, social, roleplay, economy, etc.

Future Plans
----------
I hope to add moderation commands and economy commands in the near future and then move onto making fun, games, and social commands.

"How do I support Rin Rin ❤?"
----------
It would mean the world to me if you could help me make her better as I'm an amateur programmer!
Donations may or may not become public when/if she makes her way to a host instead of being locally hosted on my computer and/or if I make a website for her, etc.
