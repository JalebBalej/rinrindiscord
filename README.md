# Rin Rin ❤

What I'm working on right now
----------
Right now I'm working on finishing the localization 100% and then I want to move onto the economy update.

Developer Note:
----------
I'm not sure what I'm planning on doing with Rin Rin ❤, I only started writing in Python recently and it's my first programming language to mess around with (besides LUA). I hope to make Rin Rin ❤ into a useful Discord bot for moderation, fun, games, social, roleplay, economy, etc.

Future Plans
----------
I hope to add moderation commands and economy commands in the near future and then move onto making fun, games, and social commands.

"How do I support Rin Rin ❤?"
----------
It would mean the world to me if you could help me make her better as I'm an amateur programmer!
Donations may or may not become public when/if she makes her way to a host instead of being locally hosted on my computer and/or if I make a website for her, etc.

Although, I'm not entirely sure if I will be able to reach the level required to actually earn money from her, so I most likely will not make a donation feature, except for an optional donation link that allows you to send whatever amount you see fit. I do not have a job at the moment, so I'm basically going to be actively developing Rin Rin.

Unlike most bots, however, I will **NOT** be making **ANY** features and commands that require you to support her development.
