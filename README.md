# rinrindiscord
My first ever Discord bot written in Python.

Developer Note:
----------
I'm not sure what I'm planning on doing with Rin Rin ❤, I only started writing in Python recently and it's my first programming language to mess around with (besides LUA). I hope I can make Rin Rin ❤ into a useful Discord bot for moderation, fun, games, social, roleplay, economy, etc.

Future Plans for Rin Rin ❤
----------
I hope to add moderation commands and economy commands in the near future and then move onto making fun, games, and social commands.

How to support Rin Rin ❤
----------
It would mean the world to me if you could help me make Rin Rin ❤ better as I'm an amateur programmer!
Donations may or may not become public when/if Rin Rin ❤ makes her way to a host instead of being locally hosted on my computer and/or if I make a website for her, etc.
